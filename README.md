Tip Calculator

In this exercise, you're tasked with creating a tip calculator using(but not limited to) the following:

-HTML
-CSS
-Javascript/jQuery

Key tips:

-Start out with working with the front end.  Try implementing the mobile first methodology.

-When you start to work on the back end, you'll be able to easily connect it to the front end using it's ids(or classes).

-Really challenge yourself.  Try not to just copy and paste someone else's code to build it.  You're more than welcome though, to look at other's code to get an idea of how you want to build it, how you want it to look, etc.
